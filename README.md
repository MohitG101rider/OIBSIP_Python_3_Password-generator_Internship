# Password Generator – Oasis Infobyte Internship

## 🎯 Objective
The aim of this project was to create a **secure password generator** that can generate strong, random passwords based on user-selected criteria (length, inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). The goal was to ensure **security** and **customizability** for end-users.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**
- `random` – To randomly generate characters
- `string` – For character sets (letters, digits, punctuation)
- `tkinter` (optional) – For GUI interface in advanced version

---

## 📝 Steps Performed
1. **Defined character sets** for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols using Python’s `string` module.  
2. **User input** for password length and criteria (e.g., include digits, symbols).  
3. **Random generation logic** using `random.choice()` to build the password securely.  
4. **Validation** to ensure minimum length and character diversity for security.  
5. **GUI Integration** with Tkinter for user-friendly input and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## 📊 Outcome
- Generated **random and secure passwords** instantly.  
- User can **customize password length and strength**.  
- Enhanced understanding of Python’s **randomization and string handling**.  
- Useful real-life application for secure account creation.
